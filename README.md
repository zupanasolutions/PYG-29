# PYG-29
Python Time Tracker

problem statement

Pascal, Prince, and Naa recently started a consulting business. Nana, one of their employees, is paid based on the number of hours and minutes he works on client projects.

He needs a time tracking program, where he enters the date and the time he started working on a task, and then the date and time when he finished a particular task. 

The program calculates the hours he spent on a task. It then calculates the amount of money Nana made tackling the task. 

Note that: Nana is paid $5 dollars per hour.

If for instance, he works from 11AM to 1:30 PM on Monday 27th July, he would make 2.5 X 5 = $12.5 dollars.
